# hackage-diff

If you run this executable on the root directory of a Haskell package, it will print the diff
between the local files and the latest version of the package in Hackage.

I use this mainly to help me write changelogs before releases. Intended for personal use, but
if you want to use it, by all means, clone it.

I understand the name clashes with that of another package. If I come up with a better name
I'll change it.
